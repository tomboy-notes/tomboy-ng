March 2020 - this patch is no longer required if using a current KControls, it
was applied to kControls on 2020-02-01

This patch is to be applied to KControls 2053958 .
It fixes an issue very similar to KControls Github issue 14 where
if you paste multiline plain text at the very end 
of a KMemo, after InsertPlainText() has inserted the first line
it gets confused about where the end of the content is. Pasting
1.
2.
3.

for eg at the very end of the content will mess up.
Solution is to add yet another call to UpdateAttributes(), this
time after the InsertParagraph call.
