# This is the Lintian override file for the tomboy-ng binary.
# It ultimatly lives in /usr/share/lintian/overrides
# and is called tomboy-ng there.
#
# tomboy-ng is built using the fpc, not gcc. So use of CPPFLAGS
# is not possible. PIE, Read-only relocations and Immediate bindings
# are enabled but Fortify Source functions is not.
tomboy-ng binary: hardening-no-fortify-functions


# This problem exists also in FPC binaries but not in source
# Perhaps its a UTF8 issue ?
